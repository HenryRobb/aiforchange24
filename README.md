# MasterEDU

MasterEDU is an online AI-Powered learning platform that teachers can use to promote the mastery of any subject for every student. Master EDU uses AI to create tailored materials to supplement classwork and help students study for Mastery.

MasterEDU is inspired by the idea of educational mastery, an instructional strategy which emphasizes tailoring the learning experience for each student. Instead of classes moving on from a subject and not guaranteeing everyone understands the previous material. Mastery learning stresses that all students attain a clear understanding of material before progressing and has shown to be successful

MasterEDU works by tracking student’s individual progress through a personalized curriculum for various different subjects. MasterEDU utilizes AI to assess students’ areas of weakness and generate tailored practice problems and learning modules that will allow the student to improve in these areas. Tailored practice problems include helpful hints and step-by-step explanations to enhance student’s understanding of content, improving their chances of reaching mastery.

Our tech stack includes a Nextjs frontend with a Javascript and Typescript (Database Schema) backend. We further used MongoDB through Mongoose and the Gemini API to help generate the supplemental materials based on the student's past performances.
